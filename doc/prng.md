# DESCRIPTION

This module implements the abstract concept of a sequence of random numbers
(deterministic for a given seed) that can form a hierarchical tree of sequences
of arbitrary complexity.  Each sequence provides utility functions for common
random number requirements: fitting common distributions, uniform distribution
across a precise range, random sorts and other common but subtle requirements,
as well as being able to save and restore the internal state to a point in
time.  Two implementations are provided, one based on a blowfish CSPRNG (which
will provide cryptographic quality pseudorandom numbers at the cost of higher
computation requirements), and the other based on a mersenne twister RNG:
MT19937 (which has a lower computation cost and good statistical randomness
but is not suitable for cryptographic purposes).

# COMMANDS

**prng::Sequence create** *seqname* *seed*
:   Create a new sequence accessible through the command *seqname* using the
    blowfish CSPRNG, seeded with the value *seed*, which is an arbitrary
    string of bytes.

**prng::mt::Sequence create** *seqname* *seed*
:   Create a new sequence accessible through the command *seqname* using the
    mersenne twister RNG, seeded with the value *seed*, which is an arbitrary
    string of bytes (but which is ideally a multiple of 4 bytes in length).
    The quality of the generated random numbers is low if the seed has many zeros.

*seqname* **random_uint32**
:   Return a random unsigned 32bit integer with uniform distribution in the interval [0, 2³²).

*seqname* **random_uint64**
:   Return a random unsigned 64bit integer with uniform distribution in the interval [0, 2⁶⁴).

*seqname* **random_number_norm**
:   Return a floating point number with uniform distribution in the interval [0, 1] with 53 bits of precision.

*seqname* **random_number_halfopen**
:   Return a floating point number with uniform distribution in the interval [0, 1) with 53 bits of precision.

*seqname* **random_number_exponential** *max*
:   TBD

*seqname* **random_int** *inc_bot* *inc_top*
:   Return a random integer with nearly uniform distribution in the interval [*inc_bot*, *inc_top*].

*seqname* **random_sort** *list*
:   Return *list* sorted randomly.

*seqname* **random_pick** *list* ?*count*?
:   Return *count* unique elements from *list*, selected randomly.  *list* must
    contain at least *count* elements.  If *count* isn't specified it defaults to 1.

*seqname* **random_normal** *mean* *stddev*
:   Return a random floating-point number with normal distribution with the
    mean *mean* and standard deviation *stddev*.

*seqname* **random_exponential** *mean*
:   TBD

*seqname* **random_gauss**
:   TBD

*seqname* **push_state**
:   Save the current sequence state to a stack.

*seqname* **pop_state**
:   Restore the most recently saved sequence state from the stack.

*seqname* **random_bytes** *count*
:   Return *count* random bytes.

*seqname* **save_state**
:   Return a value that fully captures the internal state of the sequence, suitable for passing to
    **restore_state**.

*seqname* **restore_state** *saved_state*
:   Restore the sequence internal state to what it was when *saved_state* was generated by **save_state**.

*seqname* **subsequence** ?*name*?
:   Branch a new sequence off of this one.  The resulting sequence will be of the same type as the parent,
    with an initial state seeded from the parent.  If *name* is supplied, it is the name of the command
    to access the new subsequence, otherwise a random name will be generated and returned.

# EXAMPLES

Generate some random numbers from a sequence seeded with the value "hello, sequence", and others
from a subsequence branched off that one.

~~~tcl
package require prng
package require prng::mt

prng::mt::Sequence create s1 "hello, sequence"
puts "s1 random_uint32: [s1 random_uint32]"
puts "s1 random_uint64: [s1 random_uint64]"
puts "s1 random_normal: [s1 random_normal 10 2]"
s1 subsequence s2
puts "s2 random_uint32: [s2 random_uint32]"
puts "s2 random_uint64: [s2 random_uint64]"
puts "s2 random_normal: [s2 random_normal 10 2]"
~~~

produces the output:

~~~
s1 random_uint32: 40479833
s1 random_uint64: 2179017276762469631
s1 random_normal: 10.488755572266877
s2 random_uint32: 2415070459
s2 random_uint64: 16788392099454078255
s2 random_normal: 12.399809108073061
